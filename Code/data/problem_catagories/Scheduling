In future scheduling problems, ensure that all variables are clearly defined and initialized before use. Implement error handling to catch and address issues like NameErrors early in the development process. Additionally, create a checklist of all constraints and requirements to ensure that the model accurately reflects the problem description.

Implement error handling to catch and address issues like NameErrors early in the development process. Additionally, create a checklist of all constraints and requirements to ensure that the model accurately reflects the problem description. It may also be beneficial to include comments in the code to clarify the purpose of each section and the constraints being implemented.
